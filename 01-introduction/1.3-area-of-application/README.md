# 1.3 Area of Application for Domain-Driven Design
*Duration: 3m 40s*

## Overview
This chapter explores when and where Domain-Driven Design should be applied, including the types of projects that benefit most from DDD approaches.

## Key Topics
- Software project attributes that determine DDD applicability
- When DDD is valuable vs. when it's not suitable
- Understanding business logic complexity
- Technical vs. domain complexity

## Software Project Attributes

Every software project has a set of key attributes:

### Core Attributes:
- **Amount of data** - Volume and complexity of data management
- **Performance** - Speed and responsiveness requirements  
- **Business logic complexity** - Intricacy of domain rules and workflows
- **Technical complexity** - Algorithmic and infrastructure challenges

## When to Use DDD

**DDD is valuable *only* when:**
- The project has **high business logic complexity** (e.g., enterprise systems like ERP, insurance, banking, or logistics platforms)
- The core challenge is **modeling intricate domain rules, workflows, and relationships**—not performance, scale, or infrastructure

**DDD is *not* suitable for:**
- **Big data** or **high-throughput systems** (e.g., analytics platforms, data pipelines) — the bottleneck is data volume, not domain logic
- **High-performance systems** with strict latency requirements (e.g., trading platforms, real-time gaming) — optimization and infrastructure dominate
- **CRUD or simple applications** (e.g., basic admin panels, blogs, or even social apps like Twitter) — business rules are minimal; scalability is the real challenge
- **Technically complex but domain-simple systems** (e.g., embedded systems, OS-level tools) — complexity lies in hardware/algorithms, not business concepts
