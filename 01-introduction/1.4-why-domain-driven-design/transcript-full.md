### Setting the Groundwork: Core Principles

Let's set some groundwork and talk about the basic principles we will follow in this course. In my opinion, there are two core principles in software development to which every programmer should adhere in most cases. They are **YAGNI** and **KISS**.

#### YAGNI - You Are Not Gonna Need It

**YAGNI** stands for "You Are Not Gonna Need It," and basically means you should implement only the functionality you need in this particular moment. You shouldn't try to anticipate the future needs, because most of the functionality you develop "just in case" turns out to be unused and thus, just a waste of time.

#### KISS - Keep It Short and Simple

**KISS** stands for "Keep It Short and Simple." This principle is about making the implementation of the remaining functionality as simple as possible. The point here is that the simpler your code is, the more readable, and thus more maintainable it becomes.

### Why These Principles Matter

These principles are important because they help solve two major problems we face when building software projects:

1. **Shortening the time needed for development**
2. **Keeping the code base maintainable in the long run**

### How Domain-Driven Design Complements These Principles

The beauty of Domain-Driven Design is that its practices complement these two software development principles. It allows us to:

- **Extract the central part of the problem domain**
- **Simplify it, removing most of the unnecessary complexity**
- **Express business logic in the clearest way possible**

This ability to express business logic in the clearest way possible is a single trait that makes Domain-Driven Design so appealing in enterprise-level applications.

### The Complexity Problem

It is hard to estimate how important that is. **The most difficult task in modern business line software is to keep that complexity under control.**

#### The Human Limitation

There is only so much complexity we can deal with at a time. If the code exceeds it, it becomes really hard, and at some point, even impossible, to change anything in the software without introducing some unexpected side effects.

#### The Consequences of Uncontrolled Complexity

- **Extending such a project becomes a pain**
- **Usually results in a lot of bugs**
- **This, in turn, slows the development down**
- **May eventually lead to failure of the project**

**Uncontrollable growth of complexity is one of the biggest reasons why software projects fail.**

### How Domain-Driven Design Helps

Domain-Driven Design helps prevent this complexity spiral. You will see that in this course we'll make a continuous effort to keep our code base as simple and as expressive as possible.

### Key Takeaways

1. **YAGNI and KISS** are fundamental principles for successful software development
2. **DDD complements these principles** by providing structure for managing complexity
3. **Business logic clarity** is crucial for enterprise applications
4. **Complexity control** is the most difficult challenge in modern software development
5. **Uncontrolled complexity** is a primary cause of project failure
6. **DDD provides tools** to maintain simplicity and expressiveness throughout development
