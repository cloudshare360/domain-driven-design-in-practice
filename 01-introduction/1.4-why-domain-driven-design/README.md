# 1.4 Why Domain-Driven Design?
*Duration: [Duration to be determined from course timing]*

## Overview
This chapter explores the fundamental reasons for adopting Domain-Driven Design, focusing on how DDD complements core software development principles and helps manage complexity in enterprise applications.

## Key Topics
- **YAGNI** (You Are Not Gonna Need It) principle
- **KISS** (Keep It Short and Simple) principle  
- How DDD complements fundamental development principles
- The complexity challenge in modern software development
- DDD as a solution for managing business logic complexity
- Why complexity control is critical for project success

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
- The two core principles every programmer should follow (YAGNI & KISS)
- How Domain-Driven Design enhances these fundamental principles
- Why uncontrolled complexity is the primary cause of project failure
- How DDD helps maintain code simplicity and expressiveness
- The specific value DDD provides for enterprise-level applications

## Visual Resources

The chapter includes four key diagrams that illustrate the relationship between fundamental software principles and Domain-Driven Design:

![YAGNI Principle](images/image.png)
*YAGNI (You Are Not Gonna Need It) - Demonstrates why implementing only current needs prevents waste and over-engineering*

![KISS Principle](images/image-1.png)  
*KISS (Keep It Short and Simple) - Shows how simple implementations lead to readable, maintainable code*

![Core Development Principles](images/image-2.png)
*Illustrates how YAGNI and KISS work together as the foundation of effective software development*

![DDD Benefits](images/image-3.png)
*Visualizes how Domain-Driven Design enhances and complements the YAGNI and KISS principles*

## Key Insights

### The Core Message
> **DDD's beauty lies in how it complements YAGNI and KISS principles by providing structure to manage business complexity while keeping code simple and maintainable.**

### Critical Understanding
- **Complexity control** is the most difficult task in modern business software
- **Uncontrolled complexity growth** is one of the biggest reasons software projects fail
- **DDD prevents complexity spiral** by focusing on clear business logic expression
