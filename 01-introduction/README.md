## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will understand:

1. **What Domain-Driven Design is** and its core purpose
2. **When DDD is appropriate** for your projects
3. **When DDD is NOT suitable** and why
4. **How to evaluate** software project attributes
5. **The difference** between technical and domain complexity

## 📊 Key Concepts Covered

### Software Project Attributes
- Amount of data
- Performance requirements
- Business logic complexity
- Technical complexity

### DDD Applicability Matrix
- ✅ **Perfect for**: Enterprise systems with complex business rules
- ❌ **Not suitable for**: High-performance systems, big data, simple CRUD apps
- 🤔 **Consider carefully**: Systems with mixed complexity types

## 🖼️ Visual Resources

This section includes comprehensive visual materials located in the [`images/`](images/) folder:
- Software attributes overview
- Decision frameworks
- Complexity analysis diagrams
- Real-world application examples
